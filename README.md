# Mediabox-Debian-11.2-server-iso
ISO build by Simple-cdd to to create an installer iso with most Sevarr apps configured and ready to go 
Originally this started as building a simple ISO install for Debian using simple-cdd. I Started setting up boxes for others.
In an effort to simplify installs and have the end user able to reinstall the OS this ISO builder was created and
has evolved. 
This scripts are designed to setup a home media server built on Debian. What is installed are as follows.
1. Plexmediaserver
